# Furby
Mock FRB generator (requires python2.7)
Checkout (https://github.com/vivgastro/Furby_p3) for a python3 version of this repository -- which is also being actively developed further.

### gen_furby.py

Code that generates Mock FRBs in a given range of DM, width, and SNR. Has a few options for frequency structure. Intrachannel dm smearing can be toggled on or off.

Enabling the dmsmear makes the computation memory and compute intensive. 

If required, modify the resolution in time and frequency defined in the first few lines in gen_furby.py, to make the code run faster but at the cost of accuracy of temporal/freq structure.

### Furby_reader.py

A Class to read the dada files output by the furby generator

### check_furby.py

A quick and handy tool to read and visualize a furby file

### check_type.py

A helper code to enable parsing configuration files

### parse_cfg.py

A helper code to help with parsing configuration files

### params.cfg

A config file containing the parameters of a receiving system which will be matched in the generated furby.
Noise_per_channel is an important parameter and this will dictate how much signal is put into the furby to generate the required snr
